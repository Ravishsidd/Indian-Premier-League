# Indian-Premier-League
We have the Indian Premier League data from 2008 to 2016. We have two files to begin with. Matches - giving us details of each match played. Deliveries - all the deliveries in all the matches put together. We would work on these two files to extract data on each match, batsmen and bowlers.
